# blink
 These three files are files that implement the blink class.
It is a direct implementation of the blink class that causes the light to blink at specific intervals(about one second).
I have already created the class by dividing the part already written in the example of the Arduino program into three files: blink.ino, Blink.cpp, and Blink.h.
This was a great opportunity to learn class creation techniques and how to use Arduino by creating classes directly in Arduino programming.
